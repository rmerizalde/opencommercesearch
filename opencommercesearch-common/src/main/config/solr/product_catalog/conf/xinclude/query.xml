    <!-- Max Boolean Clauses

         Maximum number of clauses in each BooleanQuery,  an exception
         is thrown if exceeded.

         ** WARNING **

         This option actually modifies a global Lucene property that
         will affect all SolrCores.  If multiple solrconfig.xml files
         disagree on this property, the value at any given moment will
         be based on the last SolrCore to be initialized.

    <!-- Solr Internal Query Caches

         There are two implementations of cache available for Solr,
         LRUCache, based on a synchronized LinkedHashMap, and
         FastLRUCache, based on a ConcurrentHashMap.

         FastLRUCache has faster gets and slower puts in single
         threaded operation and thus is generally faster than LRUCache
         when the hit ratio of the cache is high (> 75%), and may be
         faster under other scenarios on multi-cpu systems.
    -->

    <!-- Filter Cache

         Cache used by SolrIndexSearcher for filters (DocSets),
         unordered sets of *all* documents that match a query.  When a
         new searcher is opened, its caches may be prepopulated or
         "autowarmed" using data from caches in the old searcher.
         autowarmCount is the number of items to prepopulate.  For
         LRUCache, the autowarmed items will be the most recently
         accessed items.

         Parameters:
           class - the SolrCache implementation LRUCache or
               (LRUCache or FastLRUCache)
           size - the maximum number of entries in the cache
           initialSize - the initial capacity (number of entries) of
               the cache.  (see java.util.HashMap)
           autowarmCount - the number of entries to prepopulate from
               and old cache.

    <!-- Query Result Cache

         Caches results of searches - ordered lists of document ids
         (DocList) based on a query, a sort, and the range of documents requested.

    <!-- Document Cache

         Caches Lucene Document objects (the stored fields for each
         document).  Since Lucene internal document ids are transient,
         this cache will not be autowarmed.
      -->

    <!-- Field Value Cache

         Cache used to hold field values that are quickly accessible
         by document id.  The fieldValueCache is created by default
         even if not configured here.
      -->

    <!-- Custom Cache

         Example of a generic cache.  These caches may be accessed by
         name through SolrIndexSearcher.getCache(),cacheLookup(), and
         cacheInsert().  The purpose is to enable easy caching of
         user/application level data.  The regenerator argument should
         be specified as an implementation of solr.CacheRegenerator
         if autowarming is desired.

    <!-- Lazy Field Loading

         If true, stored fields that are not requested will be loaded
         lazily.  This can result in a significant speed improvement
         if the usual case is to not load all stored fields,
         especially if the skipped fields are large compressed text
         fields.

   <!-- Use Filter For Sorted Query

        A possible optimization that attempts to use a filter to
        satisfy a search.  If the requested sort does not include
        score, then the filterCache will be checked for a filter
        matching the query. If found, the filter will be used as the
        source of document ids, and then the sort will be applied to
        that.

        For most situations, this will not be useful unless you
        frequently get the same search repeatedly with different sort
        options, and none of them ever use "score"

   <!--
      <useFilterForSortedQuery>true</useFilterForSortedQuery>

   <!-- Result Window Size

        An optimization for use with the queryResultCache.  When a search
        is requested, a superset of the requested number of document ids
        are collected.  For example, if a search for a particular query
        requests matching documents 10 through 19, and queryWindowSize is 50,
        then documents 0 through 49 will be collected and cached.  Any further
        requests in that range can be satisfied via the cache.

   <!-- Query Related Event Listeners

        Various IndexSearcher related events can trigger Listeners to
        take actions.

        newSearcher - fired whenever a new searcher is being prepared
        and there is a current searcher handling requests (aka
        registered).  It can be used to prime certain caches to
        prevent long request times for certain requests.

        firstSearcher - fired whenever a new searcher is being
        prepared but there is no current registered searcher to handle
        requests or to gain autowarming data from.
